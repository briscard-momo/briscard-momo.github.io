        <p> <a href="http://perso.univ-lyon1.fr/florian.millet"> This is Briscard's page! </a> </p>
        <p> So far I have done a basic header/content/footer separation and a few navigation buttons, so nothing fancy yet...
      
      <h1> What is this page actually? </h1>
      
        <p> Currently under construction, this website will soon be flooded with creative, refreshing and fun content for everyone to enjoy ! </p>
        <p> The first thing we will post is a few lines abot us in the common section.
            Then we will probably make a short article on one of the most famous restaurants in New-Orleans: the Saint Charles Tavern.
            What a nice place to have 24/7 breakfast, nice salads, a fresh cup of Americano coffee and good music! </p>
        <p> This is going to be a fun ride =) </p>
    
      <h1> When is all of this going to be online? </h1>
    
        <p> Well, we first have to figure out what kind of stylesheet we want right now but soon after that we will have a first meeting to discuss the agenda, and then we'll be off to the races. </p>
        <p> You can expect content every other week, alternating authors, so that we have a full month to research or prepare stuff for articles while still have time to work on our actual research projects! </p>
    
      <h1> What more can you tell us? </h1>
    
        <p> Thank you for visiting this website and we hope you have a great day! </p>
